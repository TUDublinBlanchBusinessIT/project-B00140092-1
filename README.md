The website allows anyone to input their vehicle's details into the database as well as allows them to view any and all entries within the database. 

The website is accessed through the main page usedCarSite.html and the up-to-date version of the SQL will be within the main file and Version Two within the DB version folder. 

There is a tick box on the first screen that will ask if you have an up-to-date NCT, if you tick the box for yes it will send you to the end and say the data was processed successfully. But if you don't tick the box for yes, it will still upload the data to the database on submission but it will take you to another page 'nct.html' where it will recommend you to update your NCT and give you a link to "https://www.ncts.ie/" where you can do that.
